A collection of problems and solutions found on codewars.com

Like wise answers that are not my own will be addressed as such each Kata.

Depending on the level of the Kata, you may or may not find a nuanced solution that is more intuitive and
has clearer logical steps along with generally accepted best practice solutions. IE an 8Kyu problem will likely
hold the users hand more than a 5Kyu problem. Any documentation at 4Kyu and below will be to explain my logic, as it
is expected that the users at this stage ought to have a grounded understanding of the language/know how to read proper
doccumentation.

If you find some of my logic confusing, or if I am incorectly describing the way something works, please feel free to open an
issue. I will do my best to resolve it as soon as I can.
