A collection of problems and solutions found on codewars.com
You are free to use this code to help you out, just so long as credit is given where credit is due.
Like wise answers that are not my own will be addressed as such each Kata.

Depending on the level of the Kata, you may or may not find a nuanced solution that is more intuitive and
has clearer logical steps along with generally accepted best practice solutions. IE an 8Kyu problem will likely
hold the users hand more than a 5Kyu problem.
